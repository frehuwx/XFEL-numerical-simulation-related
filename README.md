# XFEL-numerical-simulation-related
Some Python scripts for X-ray free-electron laser simulations
They are mostly used for my daliy analysis and simulation. Comments are welcomed.

SDDS_class.py : io related tasks for Elegant outputs (eg. convert SDDS file to h5)

Genesis_analysis.py : io / plotting related tasks for Genesis outputs

EEHG_model.py : calculate analytical results for Echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG)

dynamic_diffraction.py : calculate numerical results on dynamic diffraction theory (can be used for self-seeding)

BeamOptics_class.py : deal with linear propagation of electrons in lattice
